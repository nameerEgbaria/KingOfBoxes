# King_of_Boxes

# Week 1:
We discussed the game idea with a lecturer and received approval to proceed with the pitch for the game. Subsequently, we created a new GitHub repository and initiated a new project in Unity. Additionally, we established a private channel on Slack to facilitate effective communication and collaboration.

### Total Hours:
#### Marah: 8 Hours.
#### Nameer: 8 Hours.

## Week 2:
We have started learning about Unity and how to use it, and now we know how to start and design in Unity.
### Total Hours:
#### Marah: 8 Hours.
#### Nameer: 8 Hours.


## Week 3+4:
We designed a player character and implemented box pushing mechanics. Additionally, we created a basic maze-like environment. In week 3, we encountered difficulties with GitHub, which took us a while to understand the cause. One of us made a commit while the other had already made changes to the game. When she performed a pull, GitHub displayed numerous errors.

### Total Hours:
#### Marah: 12 Hours.
#### Nameer: 12 Hours.


## Week 5+6:
1) We fixed the map.
2) We resolved the issue where the player would get stuck with the block by pressing "D" especially in corners, if we press "D" the box will stuck with player and move with him untill we press "D" again.
3) We implemented a 2D camera that provides an overhead view of the entire map when the "U" key is pressed. and it we press"U" again it will turn to the main camera.
4) Targets have been added to the map; when the box reaches a target, its color changes to green, and it becomes immobile.
5) If the "D" key is pressed when the box is on a target, it can be moved again. We implemented this feature for future use, such as changing the box's position to allow another box to reach a specific target.
6) We are still working on improving the camera's behavior to stay behind the player and rotate with them.

### Total Hours:
#### Marah: 16 Hours.
#### Nameer: 16 Hours.

## Week 7+8:

1) There was a problem with the box moving forward when we attached it, but we fixed it.
2) We resolved the issue of changing color when the box is not on the target.
3) We downloaded a 3D design for a player and tried to make it appear as if it were a 2D camera. However, this caused a lot of problems, so we decided to delete it.
4) We created a start screen with a button.
5) We designed a finish screen that activates when all the boxes turn green.

Nameer worked on tasks 1, 2, and 3.
Marah worked on tasks 1, 4, and 5.
