# King_of_Boxes

# Week 1:
We discussed the game idea with a lecturer and received approval to proceed with the pitch for the game. Subsequently, we created a new GitHub repository and initiated a new project in Unity. Additionally, we established a private channel on Slack to facilitate effective communication and collaboration.

### Total Hours:
#### Marah: 10 Hours.
#### Nameer: 10 Hours.

## Week 2:
We have started learning about Unity and how to use it, and now we know how to start and design in Unity.
### Total Hours:
#### Marah: 10 Hours.
#### Nameer: 10 Hours.


## Week 3+4:
We designed a player character and implemented box pushing mechanics. Additionally, we created a basic maze-like environment. In week 3, we encountered difficulties with GitHub, which took us a while to understand the cause. One of us made a commit while the other had already made changes to the game. When she performed a pull, GitHub displayed numerous errors.

#### Nameer: 16 Hours.


## Week 5+6:
1) We fixed the map.
2) We resolved the issue where the player would get stuck with the block by pressing "D" especially in corners, if we press "D" the box will stuck with player and move with him untill we press "D" again.
3) We implemented a 2D camera that provides an overhead view of the entire map when the "U" key is pressed. and it we press"U" again it will turn to the main camera.
4) Targets have been added to the map; when the box reaches a target, its color changes to green, and it becomes immobile.
5) If the "D" key is pressed when the box is on a target, it can be moved again. We implemented this feature for future use, such as changing the box's position to allow another box to reach a specific target.
6) We are still working on improving the camera's behavior to stay behind the player and rotate with them.

## Week 7+8:

1) There was a problem with the box moving forward when we attached it, but we fixed it.
2) We resolved the issue of changing color when the box is not on the target.
3) We downloaded a 3D design for a player and tried to make it appear as if it were a 2D camera. However, this caused a lot of problems, so we decided to delete it.
4) We created a start screen with a button.
5) We designed a finish screen that activates when all the boxes turn green.

Nameer worked on tasks 1, 2, and 3.
Marah worked on tasks 1, 4, and 5.

## Week 9+10

1) We make the camera move with the player to the sides and back. When we move to the right or left, the camera will move 90 degrees, and when we move backward, the camera will turn 180 degrees with the player to see what is in the back.
2) We fix the map, and we make the level harder.
3) We create another level and figure out how to move from one level to another.
4) We implement a reset button. If the box is stuck and the player decides to reset the game, pressing 'R' will take us back to the beginning of the same level.
5) When we switch to the second player (the 2D camera) and then return to the main player, we will send messages and instructions on how to move the player. We'll provide information on the number of gray boxes and how to reach the closest gray box, along with instructions on how to move to the closest target to place the box.

Nameer worked on 1+3+5, and Marah worked on 2+4+5.
